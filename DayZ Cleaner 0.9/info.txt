This script is essentially an **automated banning tool** for a DayZ game server hosted on Nitrado, and here’s how it works step-by-step:

---

### **1. What it’s for**

* It monitors **DayZ ADM log files** stored on your game server via FTP.
* It detects when players with certain flagged **Unique IDs (UIDs)** connect.
* If a flagged UID is detected, it automatically sends a **ban request** to Nitrado’s API to block that player’s gamertag.

---

### **2. Core components**

#### **FTP connection**

* Connects to the server’s FTP (`connect_ftp()`).
* Finds the latest ADM log file (`get_latest_adm()`).
* Reads new lines added to the ADM log (`read_new_lines()`).

#### **Log scanning**

* Uses a **regex pattern** (`adm_pattern`) to find lines that look like:

  ```
  Player "SomeGamertag"(id=ABC123XYZ) is connected
  ```

  * Captures the gamertag and the UID.

#### **Flaglist system**

* `flaglist.txt` stores the UIDs that should be banned if they join.
* The script loads (`load_flaglist()`) and updates (`save_flaglist()`) this list.
* You can add/remove UIDs from this file via the menu.

#### **Ban execution**

* If a flagged UID is detected in the log, the matching gamertag is sent to Nitrado’s banlist API (`ban_gamertags()`).
* Keeps track of gamertags already banned (`banned_gamertags`) to avoid repeat API calls.

### **3. The monitoring loop (`monitor()`)**

1. Connect to FTP.
2. Identify the newest ADM log.
3. Every 10 seconds:

   * Check if the server started a new log file (new game session).
   * Read any new lines added since last check.
   * Look for matches to `adm_pattern`.
   * If a match’s UID is in the flaglist → queue the gamertag for banning.
4. Send ban requests to Nitrado via `requests.post()`.

### **4. The interactive menu (`menu()`)**

When you run the script, you get:

```
1. Start monitoring and auto-ban
2. Show banned gamertags
3. Show/edit flaglist
4. Exit
```

* **Option 1**: Starts the monitoring loop and auto-bans flagged players.
* **Option 2**: Displays all gamertags that have been banned in this session.
* **Option 3**: Lets you add/remove UIDs from the flaglist.
* **Option 4**: Quits the program.

---

### **5. Key behaviors**

* **Resilience**: If FTP fails, it retries every 10 seconds.
* **Efficiency**: Reads only new log lines (not the entire file each time).
* **Avoids duplicate bans**: Tracks banned gamertags in memory.
* **Manual control**: Lets you update the flaglist without editing files directly.

---

### **6. Risks & security notes**

* Your **FTP credentials** and **Nitrado API token** are hardcoded — anyone with access to this script could control your server.
* If Nitrado’s API changes or rate-limits requests, the banning could fail.
* Misuse (wrong UIDs in the flaglist) could result in banning innocent players instantly.
